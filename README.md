# TI TMP102 Driver

Simple driver for the TI TMP102 I2C temperature sensor. For use with TI TM4C123X MCUs.

## Description

This is a very basic driver for the TI TMP102 I2C temperature sensor for use with TI TM4C123X microcontrollers. I wrote this driver solely for the learning experience, and
it is the first MCU driver I've made. Because of this, you should use caution when implementing it into your project. The current version contains no error handling or
detection.

This driver relies heavily on TI's TivaWareâ„¢ Peripheral Driver Library. Because of this, it should be portable to all TM3C123X MCUs, but was only tested using a TM4C123GH6PM.
